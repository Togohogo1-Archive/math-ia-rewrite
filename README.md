# Math IA Scripts
Original IB HL Mathematics Internal Assessment was written on Microsoft Word. I rewrote this for LaTeX practice.

This repo also contains generated images used in the IA and Python scripts for intensity map plotters and computer vision algorithms.

Submitted version of code has all comments (used for description) removed and file paths changed to `Images\filename.png` (refer to `path of tex file`)
